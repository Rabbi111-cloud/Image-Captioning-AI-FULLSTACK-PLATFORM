Full-Stack AI Image Captioning System (Gradio + FastAPI + HuggingFace Transformers)

This project is a complete end-to-end AI application that generates human-like captions for uploaded images.
It demonstrates real-world fullstack machine learning deployment using:

A Gradio frontend
A FastAPI backend
A vision-language transformer model
Cloud hosting (Render/Railway)
Users upload images on the frontend → the backend generates captions → the result is displayed instantly.
This project is perfect for showcasing fullstack ML engineering, cloud deployment, and API-driven AI systems.
